## What are Snikket circles?

When you invite people to your Snikket instance, you can organize them into
groups we call 'circles'.

Circles have the following features:

- All members within a circle will automatically have everyone else in the
  same circle on their contact list, with no need to add contacts manually.
- Circles can have one or more group chats, which automatically include all
  the circle members.
- People can be members of multiple circles.

For example, Ruby Lightfoot run a Snikket instance for her family. All Ruby's
family members are in a circle called 'Family' which she created. Ruby also
organizes a weekly board game meetup, and wants to invite her group of friends
to use Snikket, but she doesn't want them all appearing on the contact lists
of her family members. In the Snikket interface, Ruby creates a 'Game Night'
circle, and sends an invitation link with her friends.

## Default circle

Every Snikket instance is created with a default circle. The circle's name
defaults to the domain name of the instance.

## Contact list synchronization

Snikket will automatically synchronize the circle members' contact lists, so
that every member can find every other member in their Snikket contacts for
direct one-to-one messaging.

## Circle chats

Sometimes you may want to create a group chat in which everyone in the circle
should be included. Snikket allows you to create *circle chats* for this.
These chats provide shared spaces where members of a circle can easily
exchange messages and files with each other.

Circle chats can be created in the web portal, and you can choose a name for
each one. Snikket will automatically keep the membership of each chat in sync
with the circle's member list.

If you need group chats where you manage the members manually, you can always
create these normally in the Snikket app. You cannot create or manage *circle
chats* within the app.
